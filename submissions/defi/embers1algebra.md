## Developer
- **Name**: Raffaele Di Giovanni
- **GitHub**: @embers1algebra

- **Experience**: 6 years in DeFi development, with expertise in smart contract design and yield farming protocols. Contributed to liquidity pools on Uniswap V3 and built a cross-chain lending platform on Avalanche.

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: YieldHub
- **Category**: defi

### Description
YieldHub is a decentralized yield aggregator that optimizes returns for users by automatically reallocating assets across multiple DeFi protocols based on real-time yield data. It solves the problem of fragmented liquidity and suboptimal returns by providing a one-stop platform for staking, lending, and farming. Users can deposit assets, and YieldHub’s algorithm dynamically shifts them to the highest-yielding pools while minimizing gas costs and risks

### SL Integration  
YieldHub will utilize the SL for its core yield optimization logic and asset management. SL’s high-throughput transaction processing enables real-time rebalancing of user funds across protocols. We’ll leverage SL’s oracle module to fetch accurate yield data from trusted sources and SL’s secure smart contracts to execute trustless rebalancing and reward distribution. SL’s cross-chain bridges will allow integration with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain pools

## Technical

### Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture:
- **Optimization Layer**: SL smart contracts handle yield calculations and asset rebalancing
- **Frontend Layer**: React-based dashboard for user deposits, withdrawals, and analytics
- **Off-chain Layer**: Node.js backend for caching yield data and triggering rebalancing events
- **Storage Layer**: IPFS for storing pool metadata; WALRUS for encrypted user transaction logs
High-level flow: Users deposit assets, SL retrieves yield data through oracles, smart contracts rebalance assets, and rewards are distributed to the user’s wallet

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for intuitive UI; Web3.js for wallet and SL interactions
- **Backend**: Rust for SL smart contracts; Node.js for API and off-chain analytics  
- **Blockchain**: SL for core logic; Ethereum and BSC for external pool integrations
- **Storage**: WALRUS for encrypted transaction logs; IPFS for pool metadata

### Features
1. Automated yield optimization across multiple DeFi protocols
2. Real-time analytics dashboard for tracking returns  
3. Cross-chain asset bridging for broader pool access

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic functionality: Deposit/withdrawal system and single-pool yield integration on SL testnet
- [ ] SL integration: Oracle-based yield data fetching
- [ ] Simple UI: React dashboard for deposit tracking

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full features: Multi-pool rebalancing, cross-chain bridging, and reward distribution
- [ ] Production ready: Security audits, SL mainnet deployment
- [ ] User testing: Beta with 150 users from DeFi communities

## Innovation
YieldHub differentiates itself by using SL’s low-cost, high-speed transactions to enable real-time yield optimization, unlike existing aggregators that rely on slower, costlier chains. Its cross-chain compatibility and transparent oracle integration reduce reliance on single ecosystems, lowering risk. Users will choose YieldHub for its seamless experience, higher returns, and minimal gas fees, making DeFi accessible to both retail and institutional investors
